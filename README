prll
version 0.1
================

prll is a utility for use with bash or zsh. It provides a convenient
interface for parallelizing the execution of a single task over
multiple data files, or actually any kind of data that you can pass as
a function argument. It is meant to make it simple to fully utilize a
multicore/multiprocessor machine.

DESCRIPTION
-----------

prll is designed to be used not just in shell scripts, but also in
interactive shells. To make the latter convenient, it is implemented
as a shell function. Shells are not much good at automatic job
management; see [1] for further discussion. Therefore, prll uses a
jobserver, written in C. To prevent race conditions, System V Message
Queues are used to signal job completion.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

  - bash or zsh
  - C compiler, such as gcc
  - an OS supporting System V Message Queues; GNU/Linux will do fine
  - programs awk, sed, egrep, ipcs, ipcrm and ipcmk

For now, prll has only been tested on GNU/Linux. It might need minor,
simple modifications on other systems, like replacing egrep with a
different grep implementation.

prll also looks for the /proc/cpuinfo file. It uses it to
automatically determine the number of processors. Non-Linux systems
may lack this file or have a different syntax. Setting the
PRLL_NR_CPUS environment variable renders the cpuinfo file unnecessary
(see usage instructions below).

INSTALLATION
-----------

Compile prll_jobserver.c. You can use the included Makefile. If you
have gcc, you can simply run

  make

If you have a different compiler, you may want to change the default
compiler options, like so

  make CFLAGS=whatever

When this is done, copy the prll_jobserver executable to a directory
you have in your PATH. For example, to do a system-wide installation,
run as root

  chown root:root prll_jobserver
  cp prll_jobserver /usr/local/bin/

File prll.sh contains the shell function. The shell that will use it
needs to source it. That means two things: 
  - If you wish to use prll in a shell script, simply copy it in there.
  - If you wish to use prll in an interactive shell, source it.
The latter means that you need to put the function somewhere where
your shell will find it. If you are installing it for yourself, put
it in your .bashrc or .zshrc. If you are installing it system-wide, put
it in /etc/profile. However, if your system has the /etc/profile.d
directory, use that. For example

  chown root:root prll.sh
  cp prll.sh /etc/profile.d/

The function should now be automatically sourced by login shells.


USAGE
-----

Synopsis: prll function_name arguments ...

To execute a task, create a shell function that does something to its
first argument. Pass that function to prll along with the arguments
you wish to execute it on.

The number of tasks to be run in parallel is provided via the
PRLL_NR_CPUS environment variable. If it is not provided, prll will
look into the /proc/cpuinfo file and extract the number of CPUs in
your computer.

Examples:

Suppose you have a set of photos that you wish to process using the
'mogrify' utility. Simply do

  function myfn() { mogrify -flip $1 ; }
  prll myfun *.jpg

This will run mogrify on each jpg file in the current directory. If
your computer has 4 processors, but you wish to run only 3 tasks at
once, you should use

  PRLL_NR_CPUS=3 prll myfn *.jpg


If you have a more complicated function that has to take more than one
argument, you should use a trick: combine multiple arguments into one
when passing them to prll, then split them again inside your
function. Here is a stub for a function that takes three arguments:

  function myfn() { echo $1 | read a b c; process a; compute b; kill c; }
  prll myfn 'a1 b1 c1' 'a2 b2 c3' 'a3 b3 c3' ...
