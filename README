prll
version 0.1
================

prll is a utility for use with bash or zsh. It provides a convenient
interface for parallelizing the execution of a single task over
multiple data files, or actually any kind of data that you can pass as
a function argument. It is meant to make it simple to fully utilize a
multicore/multiprocessor machine.

DESCRIPTION
-----------

prll is designed to be used not just in shell scripts, but also in
interactive shells. To make the latter convenient, it is implemented
as a shell function. Shells are not much good at automatic job
management; see [1] for further discussion. Therefore, prll uses a
jobserver, written in C. To prevent race conditions, System V Message
Queues are used to signal job completion.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

  - bash or zsh
  - C compiler, such as gcc
  - OS support for System V Message Queues; GNU/Linux will do fine
  - programs awk, sed, seq, egrep, ipcs, ipcrm and ipcmk

The programs listed should be part of your system by default, except
perhaps the compiler and its toolchain.

For now, prll has only been tested on GNU/Linux. It might need minor,
simple modifications on other systems, like replacing egrep with a
different grep implementation.

prll also looks for the /proc/cpuinfo file. It uses it to
automatically determine the number of processors. Non-Linux systems
may lack this file or have a different syntax. Setting the
PRLL_NR_CPUS environment variable renders the cpuinfo file unnecessary
(see usage instructions below).

INSTALLATION
------------

Compile prll_jobserver.c. You can use the included Makefile. If you
have gcc, you can simply run

  make

If you have gcc and want different compiler options, do

  CFLAGS=whatever make

If you have a different compiler, you may want to completely override
compiler options, like so

  make CFLAGS=whatever

You may wish to run 'make test' at this point. It will do some simple
test to verify that prll produces correct results. The test suite is
not comprehensive, however, and is itself not well tested, so you
should try prll on real-world data before coming to any conclusions.

When prll is built, copy the prll_jobserver executable to a directory
you have in your PATH. For example, to do a system-wide installation,
run as root

  chown root:root prll_jobserver
  cp prll_jobserver /usr/local/bin/

File prll.sh contains the shell function. The shell that will use it
needs to source it. That means that: 
  - If you wish to use prll in a shell script, simply copy it in there.
  - If you wish to use prll in an interactive shell, source it.
The latter means that you need to put the function somewhere where
your shell will find it. If you are installing it for yourself, put
it in your .bashrc or .zshrc. If you are installing it system-wide, put
it in /etc/profile. However, if your system has the /etc/profile.d
directory, use that. For example

  chown root:root prll.sh
  cp prll.sh /etc/profile.d/

The function should now be automatically sourced by login shells. To
have every instance of bash source it, insert

  source /etc/profile

into your .bashrc.


USAGE
-----

Synopsis: prll function_name arguments ...
	  prll -s 'code' arguments ...

To execute a task, create a shell function that does something to its
first argument. Pass that function to prll along with the arguments
you wish to execute it on.

As an alternative, you may pass the '-s' flag, followed by a
string. The string will be executed as if it were the body of a shell
function. Therefore, you may use $1 to reference it's first parameter.

Instead of arguments, you can put flags '-p' or '-0'. prll will then
take it's arguments from stdin. The '-p' flag will make it read lines
and the '-0' flag will make it read null-delimited input. This mode
emulates the 'xargs' utility a bit, but is easier for interactive use
because xargs makes it hard to pass complex commands.

The number of tasks to be run in parallel is provided via the
PRLL_NR_CPUS environment variable. If it is not provided, prll will
look into the /proc/cpuinfo file and extract the number of CPUs in
your computer.

If you need to abort execution, you can do it with the usual Ctrl+C
key combination. prll will wait for remaining jobs to complete before
exiting. You can force termination by typing Ctrl+C once more. The
jobs' PIDs are printed during execution so you can easily track them
down and terminate them if necessary. prll will not do it
automatically because only you can decide whether they are still doing
useful work or not. Also, jobs print completion notifications on their
own so you will know when they are done even if prll itself is
terminated. Should that be the case, they will also print a harmless
'file not found' message because the message queue will be removed.
 
prll cleans after itself, but if you are worried about stale message
queues, you can list them with the 'ipcs' command and remove them with
the 'ipcrm' command. Refer to your system's documentation for details.


Examples:

Suppose you have a set of photos that you wish to process using the
'mogrify' utility. Simply do

  function myfn() { mogrify -flip $1 ; }
  prll myfn *.jpg

This will run mogrify on each jpg file in the current directory. If
your computer has 4 processors, but you wish to run only 3 tasks at
once, you should use

  PRLL_NR_CPUS=3 prll myfn *.jpg

Or, to make it permanent in the current shell, do

  export PRLL_NR_CPUS=3


To make things shorter, you can leave out the 'function' keyword when
defining a function. To redefine the same example:

  myfn() { mogrify -flip $1 ; }

However, you now need to be careful not to forget the parentheses. When
using the 'function' keyword, they are optional. If you leave it out,
they are not.

All examples here are very short. In practice, it is quicker to pass
such a short function on the command line directly:

  prll -s 'mogrify -flip $1' *.jpg

prll now automatically wraps the code in an internal function so you
don't have to. Don't forget about the single quotes, or the shell will
expand $1 before prll is run.


If you have a more complicated function that has to take more than one
argument, you should use a trick: combine multiple arguments into one
when passing them to prll, then split them again inside your
function. Here is a stub for a function that takes three arguments:

  # for zsh only
  function myfn() { echo $1 | read a b c; process $a; compute $b; kill $c; }
  # for both bash and zsh
  function myfn() { read a b c < <(echo $1); process $a; compute $b; kill $c; }
  prll myfn 'a1 b1 c1' 'a2 b2 c3' 'a3 b3 c3' ...


KNOWN ISSUES
------------

This section describes issues and bugs that were known at the time of
release. For more current information, check the newer version of this
file. You can find it in the project's git repository:

  http://prll.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=prll/prll;a=tree

There, you will find out which new issues were found and which of the
old issues were fixed. If you have an issue that is not described,
check the git log if it was ever found and fixed. If not, please
contact the author. Suggestions are welcome, patches even more so.


Known issues:

- Document cross-compilation and make it easier to cross-compile.

- Expand the test suite.

- Make prll a standalone program.
  Having prll as a standalone program would allow for a cleaner
  implementation without a jobserver. However, it would complicate
  interactive use, because code could only be passed in separate shell
  scripts or as strings, which is not as flexible.
  This issue can only be solved by finding a way to make interactive
  usage of a standalone program simple.
